# Music Classification using Machine Learning Techniques

This project focuses on classifying music using various machine learning techniques. It leverages different enabling functions, pooling, and other methodologies to accurately classify music tracks into specific genres or categories. The goal of this project is to provide a robust and efficient music classification system that can be used in various applications, such as music streaming platforms, recommendation systems, and content organization.

## Project Description

In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to classify music tracks into predefined genres or categories. The classification process involves several steps, including feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Key components of the project include:

- **Feature Extraction**: Music tracks are converted into a numerical representation by extracting relevant features such as spectral features, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), or other audio features. These features capture essential characteristics of the audio signals.

- **Model Training**: Machine learning models are trained using the extracted features. Various algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests, or deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks), can be employed for training.

- **Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, to assess their performance in classifying music tracks.

This repository serves as a starting point for building a music classification system. It provides code samples, datasets, and guidelines to implement and evaluate different machine learning techniques.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-classification.git
   cd music-classification
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download or prepare the music dataset (see [Data](#data) section for more details).

## Usage

The project provides a set of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to perform different tasks. Here are some common usage examples:

- **Feature Extraction**: Use the `feature_extraction.py` script to extract audio features from music tracks.

  ```bash
  python feature_extraction.py --input_dir /path/to/music/tracks --output_dir /path/to/save/features
  ```

- **Model Training**: Use the `train_model.py` script or Jupyter notebooks (`train_model.ipynb`, `train_model_cnn.ipynb`) to train a music classification model.

  ```bash
  python train_model.py --features_dir /path/to/extracted/features --model_output_path /path/to/save/model
  ```

- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using the `evaluate_model.py` script or the `evaluate_model.ipynb` notebook.

  ```bash
  python evaluate_model.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --test_data /path/to/test/data
  ```

Refer to the individual script or notebook files for more details and available options.

## Data

The success of a music classification system heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the training data. While this repository does not provide a specific dataset, there are various publicly available datasets that can be used for music classification tasks. Some popular datasets include:

- [GTZ

AN Genre Collection](http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/): A collection of 1000 audio tracks divided into 10 different genres.
- [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/): A large dataset containing audio features and metadata for a million popular music tracks.

Ensure that you have a properly labeled dataset before training the models. Preprocess the data, if required, and organize it into appropriate folders based on genre or category.

## Models

The project provides example implementations of different machine learning models for music classification. The models can be found in the `models` directory and include:

- `svm_classifier.py`: Example implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- `random_forest_classifier.py`: Example implementation of a Random Forest classifier.
- `cnn_classifier.py`: Example implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier.
- `rnn_classifier.py`: Example implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifier.

Feel free to modify or extend these models based on your requirements.

## Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of the music classification system is essential to assess its effectiveness. The project includes evaluation scripts (`evaluate_model.py`) and notebooks (`evaluate_model.ipynb`) to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
